IoT Weather station to monitor temperature and Humidity

There are two sensor nodes which designed by using Wemose d1mini.wemose contains 11 digital input/output pins, all pins have interrupt/PWM/I2C/one-wire supported (except D0) , 
one analog input(3.2V max input) And  Micro USB connection. It is compatible with Micro Python, Arduino, nodemcu. 
These two nodes are in specific areas of the outdoor environment (each with a humidity sensor and a temperature sensor).
